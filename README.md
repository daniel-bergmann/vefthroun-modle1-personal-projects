# vefthroun-modle1-personal-projects
my personal projects assignments for the Reykjavik school of web development


Module 1.1

In this project I made a static single webpage for a nan bread recipe.

I only used CSS and HTML for this project.

I got my image from unsplash.com.

I used flexbox to place my elements where I want them to be.
