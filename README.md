my personal projects assignments for the Reykjavik school of web development.


Module 1.1

In this project I made a static single webpage for a nan bread recipe.

I only used CSS and HTML for this project.

I got my image from unsplash.com.

I used flexbox to place my elements where I want them to be.

Module 1.2

In this project I made a website with a poster.

I used CSS and HTML for this project and utilized the combination of Grids and Flexbox to layout my elements. Very powerful stuff.
